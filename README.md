Hacks, Experiments, and Scripts
============
This repository contains interesting work that I've done over the years. The code that you'll find here definitely highlights my top strengths, intellectual curiosity, coding chops, scripting & scraping, general tomfoolery, and the ability to break out data structures and algorithms when it makes sense.

Interesting Singletons
--------------- 
### geneticAlgorithm.py ### 
This one is pretty cool. It's not a super complex model, but it's an implementation of the basic concepts of genetic algorithms. Starting from a base population of random strings, I use a basic fitness function and roulette sampling to randomly breed high scoring strings from the population. This continues until an optimal solution is found (the solution string is reached).  Did research on genetic algo's and put this one together during college after playing Spore. <:^)

### insert_merge.py ### 
An exercise I got during a whiteboarding interview. I thought it was an interesting problem, so I built out the implementation after the interview.

Sample Projects
--------------- 
### Algorithms ###
binaryAdd, Linear Search, knapsack greedy, knapsack dyanamic, Queues & Stacks, insertion sort, quicksort

### Concepts ###
Basic time complexity, greedy algorithms vs dynamic programming
